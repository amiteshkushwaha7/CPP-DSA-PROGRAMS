## Getting Started

To explore the programs:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-dsa-programming-portfolio.git

1. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**
   Each directory contains .c files with well-commented code. You can compile and run the programs using a C compiler like GCC.
   ```bash
   cd Array\ DS\ ASMT\ 40
   g++ -o outputfile programfile.cpp./outputfile


## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey in learning C programming. Each folder corresponds to specific assignments or topics, and the code within is written to solve various programming challenges.
